# Task 1: Cloning and Forking

# Cloning a Repository
git clone <repository_url>

# Explore the repository's structure, files, and history
cd <repository_name>
ls -la
git log

# Forking a Repository
# Fork the same repository you cloned in Task 1 to your GitHub account
# Clone the forked repository to your local machine
git clone <your_forked_repository_url>


# Task 2: Managing Branches

# Creating and Switching Branches
git checkout -b feature-update

# Making Changes and Committing
# Make changes to a file or add a new file
# For example:
# Modify a file
echo "Some changes" >> file.txt
# Or add a new file
touch new_file.txt

# Add changes to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the changes to the branch
git commit -m "Add feature-update branch and make changes"

# Merging Changes
# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the changes from the feature-update branch into the main branch
git merge feature-update


# Task 3: Handling Conflicts

# Creating Conflicts
# In your forked repository, make changes to the same file that you modified in Task 4
# Commit the changes
# For example:
echo "Some conflicting changes" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Make conflicting changes"

# Resolving Conflicts
# Create a new branch to resolve the conflict
git checkout -b conflict-resolution

# Resolve the conflict manually in the file
# Open the file in a text editor and resolve the conflicting changes
# Add the resolved file to the staging area
git add file.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Resolve conflict"

# Merge the branch back into main
git checkout main
git merge conflict-resolution


# Task 4: GitHub Pages

# Enabling GitHub Pages
# In your forked repository, create a simple HTML file (e.g., index.html)
# Enable GitHub Pages for the repository and set the source branch to main

# Accessing the Published Page
# Visit the GitHub Pages URL for your repository and verify that the HTML file is accessible online


# Task 5: Open Source Exploration

# Explore open-source projects on GitHub
# Search for a project related to your interests
# Explore the project's documentation, issues, and contribution guidelines
